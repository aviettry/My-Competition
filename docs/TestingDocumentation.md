## Getting Google Test

Our project uses Google Test, Google's C++ test framework. The download link is [here](https://github.com/google/googletest "Google Test GitHub").  

You will need to download and extract all the files into some directory.  For our project, we extracted the files into /Developer .

Depending on where you extracted the files, you might need to modify the Makefile for the tests.
